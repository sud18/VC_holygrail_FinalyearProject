His team performs preclinical studies on subjects ranging from mice to swine and primates that have supported the successful Investigational New Drug submissions for phase I trials of rAAV in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency, congestive heart failure (CHF) and Leber Congenital Amaurosis (RPE65). UF has taken the lead in sharing those preclinical data with the NGVL by depositing data in the rAAV drug master file (DMF). The development of centralized core facilities for vector production, animal toxicology, pathology, and biostatistics/bioinformatics has allowed these procedures to proceed more efficiently. Dr. Conlon is a native Texan with roots in Dallas. Having received his BS in Genetics from the Texas A&M University under the tutelage of James R.

Dr. Dre gained momentum by teaming up with fellow rappers Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Yella, MC Ren, the Arabian Prince and the D.O.C. to form N.W.A. (Niggaz With Attitude) in 1985. With his new group, he was able to produce a more hard-hitting sound. N.W.A.'s lyrics were equally harsh and explicit, reflecting life on the streets.The group's second album Straight Outta Compton (1988) sold more than 2 million copies and marked the arrival of a new genre\u2014gangsta rap. Breaking out on his own and on a new record label, Dr. Dre hit the top of the hip-hop charts with The Chronic on Death Row Records in 1992. Dr. Dre released his second solo album, 2001, in 1999. Selling millions of copies, the recording proved to be a hit on both the hip-hop and pop charts. Behind the scenes, Dr. Dre has been instrumental in launching the careers of numerous hip hop and rap artists. He acted as a track producer for many of the artists on Ruthless Records, a venture he started up with Eazy-E. Dr. Dre worked with Michel'le on her first album. With N.W.A., Dr. Dre helped produce much of the group's material. With Marion \"Suge\" Knight, Dr. Dre co-founded the rap music empire known as Death Row Records in 1991. In 1996,Dr. Dre established his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, in connection with Interscope Records. He signed numerous acts to Aftermath, but his two greatest successes came Eminem and 50 Cent. At first, Dr. Dre took flak for signing white rapper Eminem, but he soon proved the critics wrong. He produced several of Eminem's hit albums, including The Slim Shady LP (1999) and The Marshall Mathers LP (2000). With 50 Cent, Dr. Dre worked on his debut smash Get Rich or Die Tryin' (2003) among other projects.", "last_visited": "2017-08-23T19:53:42", "websites": [{"url": "http://www.facebook.com/drdre", "type": "facebook"}, {"url": "http://twitter.com/drdre", "type": "twitter"}], "born": "February 18, 1965", "url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/andre-romelle-young", "images": "https://crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_140,w_140/v1397181762/1ec1b5c14ec5915b03c4676f8ed7fdf8.png", "news": [{"date": "May 11, 2014", "article": {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/11/sucka-free-for-life/", "publisher": "techcrunch.com", "uuid": "62635979ac9e4a3baa1e25bbd112dfd8", "title": "Why We Can\u2019t Forget About\u00a0Dre"}, "publication": "TechCrunch", "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/andre-romelle-young/press"}], "_key": "75db56a502d731a3", "location": "Unknown"}

He is also Chairman of The Travel Corporation S.A., where he oversees the South African operations of the global travel group The Travel Corporation. He puts his own unique ideas into the tours that he offers, creating unforgettable experiences for the traveler. This South African native continues to put a strong emphasis on travel to South Africa, as well as newer destinations in Asia and Australia. Entry into the Travel and Leisure Market After obtaining a degree in finance from the American University, Gavin Tollman entered the travel and leisure industry with a position at Buckhead Hotel Management Company in the US. He was the Executive Vice President of the company and handled the hotel's operations and ownership negotiations with third parties. During a massive downturn in the hotel industry, he was also involved in negotiating debt restructuring and refinancing deals. After nine years, he went to Red Carnation Hotels,. He was in charge of sales, marketing and operations for the luxury boutique hotels, which at that time numbered four. A year later he was offered the title of President of Trafalgar Tours USA. He took charge of the company and grew it to be the largest European tour service working in the US. He also led Trafalgar into new markets that became very popular travel destinations, such as New Zealand, Asia, South America, Hawaii, Canada and the US. He initiated changes in travel packages that were revolutionary, in that they provided many new options to the guided traveler. Trafalgar's reach expanded considerably under his direction, and its reputation for consistent quality, good value and reliable touring remained constant. Joining The Travel Corporation in North America In 2001, Gavin Tollman became the President of The Travel Corporation, North America. With this new position, in addition to maintaining control over Trafalgar Tours, he was also responsible for the operations, sales and marketing of other companies managed by The Travel Corporation NA, such as Insight Vacations, Destination America, Contiki Holidays and AAT Kings. As he continued in these roles, he also became a non-executive director at Cullinan Holdings, Limited as well as a non-executive director at Wilderness Safaris. Current Positions of Leadership in the Travel Industry As current Chairman of The Travel Corporation (South Africa), Gavin Tollman oversees the international strategy of TTC. He identifies and develops new business opportunities while promoting South Africa as a popular tourist destination. Under his leadership, TTC signed a two year agreement with the SA Tourism Ministry to help market and promote South African tourism through Destination South Africa when TTC held its annual conference in Cape Town in 2010. He also continues his association with Trafalgar Tours as CEO and oversees marketing, sales, product development and delivery as well as all operations. He has developed programs such as Be My Guest and Hidden Treasures to provide more intimate and in-depth travel experiences, which have changed the face of typical coach tours.", "images": "https://crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_140,w_140/v1397181104/ae0ab8405a866a4a295e7f6d71e24364.jpg", "born": "October 14, 1963", "total_boards_and_advisor_roles_count": "2", "total_jobs_count": "2", "boards_and_advisor_roles_urls": ["https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman/advisory-roles"], "total_education_count": "1", "news": [{"date": "May 24, 2012", "article": {"url": "http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2011/10/20/38570/price+focus+is+plain+dumb+how+trafalgars+tollman+turned+coach+tours+around.html", "publisher": "travelweekly.co.uk", "uuid": "a032f9aca887d94c6fb223f7d5efbd26", "title": "'Price focus is plain dumb': How Trafalgar's Tollman turned coach tours around"}, "publication": "travelweekly.co.uk", "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman/press"}], "education": [{"organization": {"url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-university", "follower_count": "2", "image": "https://crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_98,w_98/v1437395484/agq03rgjaf8hn3if5j5t.jpg", "name": "American University", "uuid": "cd1fc594d4c4570a38b576488d982907"}, "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman/education"}], "primary_role": "CEO @ Trafalgar Tours", "news_urls": ["https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman/press"], "name": "Gavin Tollman", "education_urls": ["https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman/education"], "total_news_count": "1", "gender": "Male", "last_visited": "2017-08-10T16:38:28", "websites": [{"url": "https://www.facebook.com/metowe", "type": "facebook"}, {"url": "http://twitter.com/gavintollman", "type": "twitter"}, {"url": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/gavintollman", "type": "linkedin"}], "_key": "18baa1cffe76cd72", "location": "Unknown", "boards_and_advisor_roles": [{"organization": {"url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-travel-corporation-s-a", "follower_count": "0", "name": "The Travel Corporation S.A.", "uuid": "e8d0f7fa7aee5f7be44b9e53dc6bb0cf"}, "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman/advisory-roles", "period": "May 1, 2010", "title": "Chairman"}, {"organization": {"url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wilderness-safaris", "follower_count": "0", "image": "https://crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_98,w_98/v1476945888/o2ulfqpaerurc9dofvca.png", "name": "Wilderness Safaris", "uuid": "33f309bf8fb7f9acaa67ab21ce904dab"}, "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman/advisory-roles", "period": "Jan 14, 2010", "title": "Non-Executive Director"}], "url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gavin-tollman"}

When I founded Omegawave, I was also doing a lot of coaches counseling for different sport organizations and I saw how coaches were always looking for better training solutions. Being a coach and a former track and field athlete myself \u2013 as well as an expert in physiological readiness.I wanted to use my expertise to help create those new training solutions. As Val puts it, Omegawave\u2019s approach is different than other sports applications on the market that just measure what you\u2019re doing or what you\u2019ve done. Instead of a simple measurement, Omegawave shows you whether the training you did was good or bad for your body \u2013 and then offers advice on better ways to train. It really motivates me to see how our technology has helped so many coaches to become better and guided so many athletes to reach a higher level. With the new mobile application, Val sees Omegawave positioned to be of value in any situation where people have to deal with stress. But the basic principle, the overall concept, remains the same. As long as we can contribute to someone\u2019s health and performance, this is valuable. Only the challenges are different: for elite athletes it may mean winning gold, for someone else it may be running 10 kilometers or just staying in better shape. Val also praises Finland as a great location for Omegawave. In addition to the government support for innovative business, Val appreciates the very high concentration of well-educated and highly skilled people available to provide their services at a reasonable price. At Omegawave, we\u2019re still full of ideas and don\u2019t plan to stop where we are right now. Though the business keeps me busy, every time I have an opportunity I enjoy cycling, running and rollerblading. And when I happen to watch TV, I prefer track and field sports, the Olympic games and World Cup Soccer.", "total_jobs_count": "1", "images": "https://crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_140,w_140/v1397184964/9fdd77ffe9de0e858de49a3b5d7aac4e.jpg", "news": [{"date": "Oct 13, 2014", "article": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-13/under-armour-holds-a-game-show-to-find-its-future", "publisher": "bloomberg.com", "uuid": "f8c0b8e8f0ca46df80c9ecc0666f499b", "title": "Under Armour Holds a Game Show to Find Its Future"}, "publication": "Bloomberg", "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/val-nasedkin/press"}], "primary_role": "Co-Founder & Vice President of Business Development @ Omegawave", "news_urls": ["https://www.crunchbase.com/person/val-nasedkin/press"], "name": "Val Nasedkin", "total_news_count": "1", "gender": "Male", "last_visited": "2017-07-09T07:49:27", "websites": [{"url": "http://fi.linkedin.com/pub/val-nasedkin/82/72/505", "type": "linkedin"}], "url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/val-nasedkin", "location": "Portland", "_key": "62a43b8004186ed6"}

Wai Hong's experience as an entrepreneur draws its depth from the different cycles that the business has undergone, from the initial days of dabbling with eBay to building multiple full fledged award-winning eCommerce stores. Wai Hong was also named Australia's Best Young Entrepreneur in 2011 by StartupSmart and amongst Melbourne's top 100 most influential people by The Age Newspaper that same year. Wai Hong has since spent 1.5 years living in Shanghai where he studied Chinese and eventually returned to Malaysia in 2013 where he founded his latest venture, StoreHub, a Beautiful, Cloud Based Store Management System for SMEs.

That year he was a Pulitzer finalist for a series of stories on Native American culture. In 1985, during the Midwest farm crisis, he wrote a series entitled \"Life on the Land: an American farm family\", which followed a typical southwest Minnesota farm family through the course of a full year. He worked part-time at the Pioneer Press in 1989 and left the next year. In 1989, Camp wrote two novels. The Fool\u2019s Run was published under his own name, but the publisher asked him to provide a pseudonym for Rules of Prey (Prey series) so it was published under the name \"John Sandford\". In 2007, Camp started a third series, featuring Virgil Flowers, who was a supporting character in some of the Prey novels, including Invisible Prey and Storm Prey."}

Rudy\u2019s bankruptcy practice focuses on the representation of secured creditors, creditors\u2019 committees and trustees in business-related bankruptcy proceedings. Rudy also represents the firm\u2019s business clients as plaintiffs and defendants in complex commercial litigation at the trial and appellate levels in courts throughout the United States. Rudy\u2019s comprehensive practice includes representing clients in connection with corporate governance and fiduciary obligations, systems development and integration, other failed information technology systems and implementation projects, trade secret protection, copyright/trademark licensing and protection, breach of contract claims and assorted business torts. Rudy has argued cases before a number of appellate courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States and the Illinois Supreme Court. Notably, in Raleigh v. Illinois Department of Revenue, 530 U.S. 15 (2000), Rudy represented the Chapter 7 Trustee in a dispute with state and federal taxing authorities concerning the allocation of the burden of persuasion in an objection to a tax claim filed in bankruptcy court. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s underlying decision reported at In re Stoecker, 179 F.3d 546 (7th Cir. 1999), authored by Chief Judge Richard Posner, \u201ccommend counsel for both parties (Benjamin Goldgar for the state and Robert Radasevich for the trustee) for their excellent briefs and argument.\u201d With the proliferation of alternative dispute resolution proceedings, Rudy has extensive experience in arbitration and mediation proceedings before various ADR forums. He also advises his clients on general corporate issues and business strategies and has lectured frequently on commercial law and insolvency related issues. Recently, Rudy was part of a Neal Gerber Eisenberg team that represented an undersecured lender that invoked a \u00a71111(b) election \u2013 a provision that has been in the Bankruptcy Code for over 30 years but seldom used \u2013 in a case that has great significance for undersecured lenders holding distressed real estate collateral. In In re River East Plaza, LLC, Rudy represented LNV Corp., an affiliate of Beal Bank., in a SARE Chapter 11 case, in which his team was able to prevent the debtor from effectively cashing out the secured lender at the current depressed value of its real estate collateral. As a result of the ruling in River East Plaza, a \u00a71111(b) election may be an effective defense to a debtor\u2019s attempt to cram down a bankruptcy plan on a grossly undersecured real estate lender. Rudy is a lecturer on bankruptcy-related topics and has served as a panelist at conferences sponsored by the American Bankruptcy Institute and the American Bar Association. Over the past several years, Rudy has been an adjunct professor at the John Marshall Law School teaching a class entitled deposition practicum. Since 2013, Rudy has been selected by his peers for inclusion in The Best Lawyers in America in Commercial Litigation. A 1981 graduate with honors from The DePaul University College of Law, Rudy served as an editor of the DePaul Law Review.", "images": "https://crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_140,w_140/v1416286606/hvni5zip0bi9ukg5gzdd.jpg", "education_urls": ["https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robert-radasevich/education"], "total_jobs_count": "1", "total_education_count": "2", "education": [{"organization": {"url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/depaul-university-college-of-law", "follower_count": "0", "name": "DePaul University College of Law", "uuid": "87c12cc369eec5b030efe56a2c12f1fc"}, "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robert-radasevich/education", "period": "1981", "title": "JD"}, {"organization": {"url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/southern-illinois-university", "follower_count": "0", "image": "https://crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_98,w_98/v1408990103/e6die5mxd7fgxqcuajjk.png", "name": "Southern Illinois University", "uuid": "9976fe4d9fb22f93f892373ba335d850"}, "source_url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robert-radasevich/education", "period": "1978", "title": "BA"}], "primary_role": "Partner @ Neil Gerber Eisenberg LLP", "name": "Robert Radasevich", "url": "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/robert-radasevich", "gender": "Male", "last_visited": "2017-07-10T00:26:53", "websites": [{"url": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertradasevich", "type": "linkedin"}], "_key": "56d6dd705d533b1a", "location": "Chicago"}

In his years working on Web Search and Internet Advertising, Stata observed, and helped develop, a (\u201cbig\u201d-)data-driven, science-based, closed-loop approach to driving rapid, continuous improvement in business performance. The mission of VertiCloud is to bring that approach to all business verticals. Stata comes to VertiCloud from Yahoo!, Inc., where he most recently held the position of Chief Technical Officer. In the first half of his seven years at Yahoo, he was a technical leader in the Search and Advertising Technology Group. During this period, he sponsored Yahoo\u2019s extensive, Open Source contributions to the Apache Hadoop project, and drove the widespread adoption of Hadoop throughout their search and advertising products. In the second half of his time at Yahoo, Stata provided technical leadership at the corporate level, where he helped the whole company adopt the Data Science techniques pioneered in search and advertising, and to adopt the Hadoop-based Big Data platform on which those techniques depended.
